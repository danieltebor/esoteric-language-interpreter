# Esoteric Language Interpreter
Esoteric is a made-up language explicitely designed to have a structure that is easy to write an interpreter for. Esoteric Language Interpreter is the interpreter built for Esoteric, although it would be more accurate to say that the developement of the interpreter is what defined the syntax and structure of Esoteric.

## Description
For the class TCOM 2010 at KSU, one of the assignments was to make a hypothetical proposal to one of the deans regarding and issue related to the school or one of our classes and how to fix it. My teammates were, at the time, taking the class CS 4308, which is COncepts of Programming languages. According to them, the language students had to create an interpreter for, Julia, wasn't the optimal language syntactically for students to create a functioning interpreter in a reasonable amount of time. Thus, our team set out to test the feasibility of creating the syntax for a language that is easy to interpret, dubbed Esoteric. Our findings could then be compiled into a proposal paper that could hypothetically be sent to the dean. This repository contains the syntax that I created for Esoteric as well as the interpreter that I built to run it. The other team members also did their own development and testing.

## Project Goals
* Build a scanner that reads in code and removes whitespace and unecessary characters
* Build a tree-like data structure that is built from the scanned code and that can then be executed
* Build an executor that then executes the tree built from the scanned code

## Contributers
* Daniel Tebor
* Ethan Hunt
* Justin Bull
* Mohammed Rehaan
